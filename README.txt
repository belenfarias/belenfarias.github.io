This is my personal website, I hope you enjoy!

1. After checking my code, it should all be working properly.
2. I went to office hours with Michael Robinson, Raffi and Prof. Ming also helped.
3. Iâ€™d say maybe 10 hours, mostly because I kept changing the layout of the site and had a hard time creating the cs website.
