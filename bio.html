<h1> HELLO! </h1>
<p> My name is Belen Farias and I am a junior majoring in Engineering Psychology and American Studies and minoring in Entrepreneurship Leadership
Studies. I am originally from Chile but now live in Miami, Florida. I love to swim and go to the beach, especially at sunset.
I'm very interested in cognitive abilities, how humans interact with technology and product design.
I am also very involved in social justice work and hope to find a career that works closely with people.
In an ideal world, I'd combine my passion for design, technology, psychology and social justice into one. I also like to box and play soccer! </p>
